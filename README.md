- 👋 Yo, I’m @DoraDaExplora, or Mitya Nikulin.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Drum&Bass, and Mechanical Keyboards.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Information Security in Moscow, Russia and working at Edstein as a junior frontend developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will benefit at least someone and give me some more interesting experience.
- 📫 HMU on Telegram: @LaExplorad0ra.
- 🤡 One day I've spent 6 hours to get my Hackintosh back up again. Guess what? This was typed from it.

- ⌨️: Vortex Race III RGB / Cherry MX Silent Red.

- 🍻 I mainly use GitLab, because of my work right now, so you'll probably not see many activity here :/
